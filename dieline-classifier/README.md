# Package dieline classification

## Running

The dataset used in this project is the property of Adobe and can not be shared. 
Therefore, you're welcome to browse the code but you'll have a hard time
running it.

## Development

If you want to look at the code, it's in the `dieline_classifier` directory. Start 
with `main.py`.

Here's a quick description of the directories in this repo:

- `data` - Empty.
- `dieline_classifier` - The code. 
- `graphs` - Histogram with the categories of the input data.
- `tests` - Tests for custom hyperparameter tuner.
- `vector_round1` - Results from first round of hyperparameter tuning on vector data.
- `vector_round2` - Results from second round of hyperparameter tuning on vector data.
- `image_round1` - Results from first round of hyperparameter tuning on image data.
- `image_round2` - Results from second round of hyperparameter tuning on image data.

The `environment.yml` file contains the Conda environment used to set up the 
prerequisites to run the code.
